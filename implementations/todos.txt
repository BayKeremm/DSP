Music therapy session:
	You follow the professor ==> polyphonic music of the same notes.
URGENT steps:
	- use librosa NMF
	- figure out functions to get onset times and f0 estimate
	- ask about the functions and how to improve
	==> 
		get the maximum of the W[:,n] and set it to f0
		use librosa peak_pick on H[n] to get the onsets of the f0

QUESTIONS:
	Do I have to implement the NMF myself
	Do I have to implement peak_picking myself
	Are these steps reasonable?
		get the maximum of the W[:,n] and set it to f0
		use librosa peak_pick on H[n] to get the onsets of the f0
	
	Another method:
		onsets and autocorrelation ==> could it be better?
